# Unity DOTS / ECS Physics Double Floating Point Support

This project is a personal undertaking to implement full double floating point support into the new Unity DOTS framework. It includes enhancements to numerous DOTS packages, but especially to com.unity.mathematics and com.unity.physics to support double-based transforms and associated operations across the full spectrum of geometric types and associated mathematical operations.

If you would like to gain access to this code for use in your own projects, please contact me. A $200 donation per Unity release year will provide you access to the associated repositories for that Unity release year, including all the code changes I've made to support double-based physics. This is still very much an unfinished work in progress. I will not be providing any guarantee of any kind of support in using the code. However, if you have any meaningful code contributions to make, I am very much open to discussing them with you and am always open to review pull requests to the repositories.
